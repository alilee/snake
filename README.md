# Snake game in Bevy

We're learning rust and bevy and you're welcome to come along for the ride. The RustBuddies discord is a clearinghouse for side-projects, so come and join: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/huZCJ4j5).

## How will we eat this elephant?

We are going through these phases:

1. get a window up or something?
2. move a snake head around?
3. put some apples out
4. collide head with apples, and remove
5. grow snake length when apples hit
6. detect when head collides with body
7. scoring
8. sound
9. multiplayer (are you kidding?)

We are currently on step 1!

## How to participate

You are welcome to submit a pull request for any step, even the one's we've moved past, and you'll probably get some feedback on your code. We also welcome multiple PR's for the same step! Comparing our code is part of learning and we are all beginners at rust and/or bevy.

## Docs and tests

These are not necessary at all - but you are probably doing yourself a favour if you spend some of your cycles thinking about how you would do this in a project where it matters.
